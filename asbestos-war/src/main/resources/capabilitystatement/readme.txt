NOTICE:
Since the FHIRToolkit proxy only has a single Proxy\FHIR-base, it was not possible to distinguish the MHD actor in question. Hence, the capability statements of the MHD Document Responder and the MHD Document Recipient were combined into one capability statement, in the respective order.
The order of the REST features described as per the actors in this capability statement is due to the grouping of rest transaction-code interactions, it would be better to keep the same type of transaction-code interactions together.
