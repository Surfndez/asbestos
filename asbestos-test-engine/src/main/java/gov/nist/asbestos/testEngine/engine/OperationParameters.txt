operation.params

Path plus parameters after [type]. Used to set parts of the request URL explicitly.

If "url" element is specified, then "targetId", "params", and "resource" elements will be ignored as "url" element will have everything needed for constructing the request url.

If "params" element is specified, then "targetId" element is ignored.

For FHIR operations that require a resource (e.g. "read" and "vread" operations), the "resource" element must be specified when "params" element is specified.

If "url" and "params" elements are absent, then the request url will be constructed from "targetId" fixture if present.

For "read" operation, the resource and id values will be extracted from "targetId" fixture and used to construct the url. For "vread" and "history" operations, the versionId value will also be used.

Test engines would append whatever is specified for "params" to the URL after the resource type without tampering with the string (beyond encoding the URL for HTTP).

The "params" element does not correspond exactly to "search parameters". Nor is it the "path". It corresponds to the part of the URL that comes after the [type] (when "resource" element is specified); e.g. It corresponds to "/[id]/_history/[vid] {?_format=[mime-type]}" in the following operation: GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid] {?_format=[mime-type]}

Test engines do have to look for placeholders (${}) and replace the variable placeholders with the variable values at runtime before sending the request.

operation.requestId

The fixture id (maybe new) to map to the request

If a requestId is supplied, then the resulting request (both headers and body) is mapped to the fixture ID (which may be entirely new and previously undeclared) designated by "requestId".

If requestId is not specified, it is the test engine's responsibility to store the request and use it as the requestId in subsequent assertions when assertion path and/or headerField is specified, direction is equal to request, and the requestId in not specified.

operation.responseId

The fixture id (maybe new) to map to the resource.

If a responseId is supplied, and the server responds, then the resulting resource (both headers and body) is mapped to the fixture ID (which may be entirely new and previously undeclared) designated by "responseId".

If responseId is not specified, it is the test engine's responsibility to store the resource and use it as the responseId in subsequent assertions when assertion path and/or headerField is specified and the responseId is not specified.

operation.sourceId

The id of the fixture used as the body of a PUT or POST request.

operation.targetId

Id of fixture used for extracting the [id], [type], and [vid] for GET requests.

If "url" element is specified, then "targetId", "params", and "resource" elements will be ignored as "url" element will have everything needed for constructing the request url.

If "params" element is specified, then "targetId" element is ignored.

For FHIR operations that require a resource (e.g. "read" and "vread" operations), the "resource" element must be specified when "params" element is specified.

If "url" and "params" elements are absent, then the request url will be constructed from "targetId" fixture if present.

For "read" operation, the resource and id values will be extracted from "targetId" fixture and used to construct the url. For "vread" and "history" operations, the versionId value will also be used.
