Changing port
The default port used by the FhirToolkit web application is 9760. This value is reflected in the FhirToolkit Capability Statement and also used by the backend API calls. If you wish to change the port, stop the Tomcat instance and please update the following:

a. Update the relevant part of the fhirToolkitBase property in <installation-directory>\Toolkits\FhirToolkit\webapps\ROOT\serviceProperties.json

b. Update the relevant part of the fhirToolkitBase property in <installation-directory>\Toolkits\FhirToolkit\webapps\asbestos\WEB-INF\classes\service.properties

c. Update the relevant part of the <installation-directory>\Toolkits\FhirToolkit\conf\server.xml  
(Other Tomcat related ports such as 9705, 9709, 9743 are also configured in the same server.xml file.)

Restart Tomcat.
